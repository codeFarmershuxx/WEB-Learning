    <div class="title"> JavaScript </div>
    <p>
        <span class="sp1">JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core
            technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.</span> <span class="sp2"> Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the
        client side for web page behavior,</span> often incorporating third-party libraries.All major web browsers
        have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="sp1">JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard</span>. It
        has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm,
        supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. <span class="sp2">It has application programming
        interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
        and the Document Object Model (DOM).</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        The ECMAScript standard does not include any <span class="sp1">input/output (I/O)</span>, such as networking, storage, or graphics
        facilities. In practice, the web browser or <span class="sp2">other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a
        variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
    </p>

    <p>
        Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages
        are distinct and differ greatly in design.
